This is a terminal application that's emulating an art gallery with a user system and a text file data base. The app demonstrates presistance (information is maintianed between sessions) and allows users to order and view paintings. It also has an employee login and orders to clients. This was a school project that I made as part of my data structures and as a result we wrote our own data structures for the project. The video above demonstrateds the ability of clients to log in and view paintins ordered by price. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/adam100150/virtual-art-gallery).

This is a tic-tac-toe game made in python using the pygame library. I made this project to learn more about AI. This AI in this project uses a minimax tree which examins the state of the board and decides the best move based in a heuristic that's assigned to different game states.
