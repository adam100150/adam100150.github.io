I am a software and hardware enthusiast. I like making software and hardware projects and discussing the interface between the two.

# Projects
## Virtual Art Gallery

This is a terminal application that's emulating an art gallery with a user system and a text file database. The app demonstrates persistence (information is maintained between sessions) and allows users to order and view paintings. It also has an employee login and orders to clients with data maintained in data structures (BST, Hash Table, Heap, and Linked List) written from scratch for the project. The video above demonstrates the ability of clients to log in and view paintings ordered by price. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/adam100150/virtual-art-gallery).


## Tic-tac-toe with AI

This is a tic-tac-toe game made in Python using the pygame library. I made this project to learn more about AI. This AI in this project uses a minimax tree which examines the state of the board and decides the best move based on a heuristic that's assigned to different game states. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/adam100150/tic-tac-toe).

## Lyrics and Quotes

I love looking at meaningful lyrics and quotes so I made a website where people can share and talk about them. The website is built using Firebase Realtime Database and Svelte as its UI framework. Click [here](https://lyricsandquotes.org/) to go to the website and [here](lyricsandquotes) to see the design document.
